# Ethereum Wallet Creation
This Nugget shows how to create a wallet from a randomly created account. It then creates the same wallet by using the Mnemonic that was returned from the randomly created account. Then, it creates a wallet from the Private Key that was originally created.

The newly created accounts are written to a file for easy reference or to import. This file is called Accounts.txt and located in the create-wallet directory.

## Usage
```
node create-wallet/createWallet.js
```
or
```
npm run createWallet
```
